==========long example, Iliad 11.571 ===============
τὰ δὲ δοῦρα θρασειάων ἀπὸ χειρῶν
ἄλλα μὲν ἐν σάκεϊ μεγάλῳ πάγεν ὄρμενα πρόσσω,
πολλὰ δὲ καὶ μεσσηγύ, πάρος χρόα λευκὸν ἐπαυρεῖν,
ἐν γαίῃ ἵσταντο λιλαιόμενα χροὸς ἆσαι.

 And spears
hurled against him from daring hands, stuck, some indeed in his ample
shield, and many, though eager to glut themselves with his flesh, stood
fixed in the ground between, before they could reach his fair skin.

-------------

Τὸν δ᾽ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησ᾽ Εὐαίμονος ἀγλαὸς υἱὸς
Εὐρύπυλος πυκινοῖσι βιαζόμενον βελέεσσι,

Whom when Eurypylus, the illustrious son of Evæmon, perceived pressed
hard with many darts, 

----

στῆ ῥα παρ᾽ αὐτὸν ἰών, καὶ ἀκόντισε δουρὶ φαεινῷ,
καὶ βάλε Φαυσιάδην Ἀπισάονα ποιμένα λαῶν
ἧπαρ ὑπὸ πραπίδων, εἶθαρ δ᾽ ὑπὸ γούνατ᾽ ἔλυσεν·

advancing he stood beside him, and took aim with
his shining spear; and smote Apisaon, son of Phausias, shepherd of the
people, in the liver, under the diaphragm; and immediately relaxed his
limbs.

----------

Εὐρύπυλος δ᾽ ἐπόρουσε καὶ αἴνυτο τεύχε᾽ ἀπ᾽ ὤμων. 580

τὸν δ᾽ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησεν Ἀλέξανδρος θεοειδὴς
τεύχε᾽ ἀπαινύμενον Ἀπισάονος, αὐτίκα τόξον
ἕλκετ᾽ ἐπ᾽ Εὐρυπύλῳ, καί μιν βάλε μηρὸν ὀϊστῷ
δεξιόν·

 And when godlike Alexander observed him stripping off the armour
of Apisaon, he instantly bent his bow against Eurypylus, and smote him
with an arrow upon the right thigh;

---------------

 ἐκλάσθη δὲ δόναξ, ἐβάρυνε δὲ μηρόν.

 and the reed was broken, and pained
his thigh.

----------------

[...]

-----------

Ὣς ἔφατ᾽ Εὐρύπυλος βεβλημένος· οἱ δὲ παρ᾽ αὐτὸν
πλησίοι ἔστησαν σάκε᾽ ὤμοισι κλίναντες
δούρατ᾽ ἀνασχόμενοι·

So spake the wounded Eurypylus, and they stood very near him, resting
their shields upon their shoulders, and lifting up their spears.
