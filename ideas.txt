  πάσχω is really "to experience"

  Odyssey 22.173–177
    σφῶϊ δ' ἀποστρέψαντε πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ὕπερθεν
    ἐς θάλαμον βαλέειν, σανίδας δ' ἐκδῆσαι ὄπισθε,
    σειρὴν δὲ πλεκτὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ πειρήναντε
    κίον' ἀν' ὑψηλὴν ἐρύσαι πελάσαι τε δοκοῖσιν,
    ὥς κεν δηθὰ ζωὸς ἐὼν χαλέπ' ἄλγεα πάσχῃ.
  Describes a form of physical torture, ending in "ἄλγεα πάσχῃ".
  Generally what is suffered in physical pain is: ἄλγος/ἄλγεα, πῆμα/πήματα
  Also γίγνομαι, συμβαίνω

Modern Greek: πονάει το κεφάλι μου (google translate)
possibly there's some verb I haven't found, or it's something like "my head gives me pain"

Iliad 5.392 -- description of  Menelaus wounded by an arrow, treated by a doctor
interesting discussion of gods being wounded by mortals (demigods?)
  "But he [Pluto] went to the palace of Jove, and the lofty Olympus, grieving in his heart, and transfixed with
     pains; for the shaft had pierced into his huge shoulder, and tortured his soul."
  "Juno also suffered, when the brave son of Amphitryon [Hercules] smote her in the right breast with a three-pronged shaft.
                     Then most irremediable pain seized her."
    τλῆ δ’ Ἥρη, ὅτε μιν κρατερὸς πάϊς Ἀμφιτρύωνος
    δεξιτερὸν κατὰ μαζὸν ὀϊστῷ τριγλώχινι
    βεβλήκει· τότε καί μιν ἀνήκεστον λάβεν ἄλγος.
    τλάω = to suffer, τλῆ=aor (contracted?)

healing of gods
    
  "Thus he spoke, and ordered Pæon to heal him:"
passage describing people being killed and grievously wounded
  "He on his part was eagerly dragging by the foot Iphidamas his brother,"
"She spoke, and with her palms wiped off the ichor from her hand: the hand was healed, and the severe pains mitigated."

excellent example to study
  "he instantly bent his bow against Eurypylus, and smote him with an arrow upon the right thigh; and the reed was broken, and pained his thigh."
  Εὐρύπυλος δ᾽ ἐπόρουσε καὶ αἴνυτο τεύχε᾽ ἀπ᾽ ὤμων. 580
  τὸν δ᾽ ὡς οὖν ἐνόησεν Ἀλέξανδρος θεοειδὴς
  τεύχε᾽ ἀπαινύμενον Ἀπισάονος, αὐτίκα τόξον
  ἕλκετ᾽ ἐπ᾽ Εὐρυπύλῳ, καί μιν βάλε μηρὸν ὀϊστῷ
  δεξιόν· ἐκλάσθη δὲ δόναξ, ἐβάρυνε δὲ μηρόν.

  βάλε μηρὸν ὀϊστῷ δεξιόν = hit the right thigh (accusative) with an arrow (dative)

  Here βαρύνω=weigh down, oppress

stereotyped phrases
  ἄλγεα πάσχων
  πάθοι ἄλγεα θυμῷ
text from buckley
  "left him suffering with the evil sting of a deadly serpent." Iliad 
  "suffer" is mostly "suffer him to" or to suffer in general
blood is often "black"
"While he was thus speaking, the end of death covered him as to his eyes
    and nostrils; but Patroclus, trampling with his heel upon his breast,
    drew out the spear from his body, and the midriff 535 followed with it;
    and he drew out at the same time his life and the point of the weapon."
======================================================
How do we say that a body part hurts?
Woodhouse has no entry for intransitive "hurt."
======================================================

The constuctions seem to be:
  I suffer pain -- using τλάω, πάσχω, ἄλγος/ἄλγεα, πῆμα/πήματα
  Pain oppresses me -- using βαρύνω (note semantic similarity between τλάω, βαρύνω)
  Pain seizes me -- using ἄλγος, λαμβάνω 

why is αἵματι, a dative, so common?

stereotyped constructions
  ῥέε δ’ αἵματι γαῖα (is this the accusative γαῖαν with movable nu?)
  αἵματι φωτῶν
other examples
  παλάσσετο δ’ αἵματι θώρηξ
  μιάνθην αἵματι μηροὶ 4.146
  ῥέε δ᾽ αἵματι γαῖα μέλαινα.
  πᾶσιν δὲ παρήϊον αἵματι φοινόν

Answer: it's common as an indirect object, in phrases like "stained with," "sprinkled with."

Iliad 4.146
τοῖοί τοι Μενέλαε μιάνθην αἵματι μηροὶ
εὐφυέες κνῆμαί τε ἰδὲ σφυρὰ κάλ’ ὑπένερθε.
so,
Menelaus, were thy well-proportioned thighs, and legs, and fair feet
below, stained with gore.

Iliad
πάντῃ δὴ πύργοι καὶ ἐπάλξιες αἵματι φωτῶν 430
ἐῤῥάδατ᾽ ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀπὸ Τρώων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν.
Everywhere the towers and buttresses were sprinkled, on both
sides, with the blood of heroes, from the Trojans and the Greeks.
  ῥαίνω = sprinkle, φώς=man
